
what is this?
directed  graph handler project
reads the vertices and the edges from a file and do the following

	(1) Print Adjacency List              
	(2) Print Single-Source Shortest Path 
	(3) Print Indegree of Each Vertex     
	(4) Print Topological Sort of Graph   
	(5) Exit Program

How did i do it?

After carefully reading the assignment instructions, and reading the lectures and the algorithms 
i implemented the topological sort algorithms from chapter 9 lecture page 10
the shortest path algorithms dijkstra's Algorithm from chapter 9 lecture page 42
